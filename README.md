# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Imad, an experienced Android app developer with a strong background in Kotlin and Java. With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I have a deep understanding of Google APIs, networking libraries, and Android design patterns. My expertise also extends to version control using Git and utilizing AWS S3 Bucket for efficient data storage. I have successfully integrated RFID technology into applications and possess the skills to optimize app performance using various techniques. I'm well-versed in utilizing third-party libraries to enhance functionality and user experience.
